  <h4>
  Her name is cool
  </h4>
    <p>
    Darcy, it's an amazing name.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUhSdozvGvc&t=69s"> She even made a whole video explaining how great it is.</a>
    </p>
  <h4>
  She has a great taste in music
  </h4>
    <p>
    From 90s Hip Hop to bubblegum Kpop, Darcy enjoys any and all great songs. But she’ll probably annoy you with songs to listen to along with asking for music recommendations so have a playlist ready.

  <h4>
  She’s an Athlete
  </h4>
    <p>
    JV soccer captain and a fencer she’ll keep you on your toes. She’s is shape exactly 82% of the time and makes sure to get her steps in. Safe to say you’ll be taking the stairs instead of the escalator when you’re with her.
    </p>
  <h4>
  Her hair is beautiful
  </h4>
    <p>
    Winning the genetic lottery Darcy’s caramel hair can naturally form luscious curls or waves depending on the day. She also talks about her hair in her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUhSdozvGvc&t=69s">name video</a>.

  <h4>
  She’s a young scholar
  </h4>
    <p>
    Darcy has always valued education. Being on the honor roll since middle school you could call her a young scholar. Be prepared for her to be busy with homework and not text you back. (Tragic)
    </p>
  <h4>
  She’s an Artist
  </h4>
    <p>
    Art has been a passion of her’s since she was young. She is in her schools multimedia academy. <a href="https://sites.google.com/slamfamily.com/darcyslamportfolio">Here’s her multimedia academy portfolio</a>. On the portfolio, there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUhSdozvGvc&t=69s">her name video</a>. Please just watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUhSdozvGvc&t=69s">her video about her name</a>.

  <h4>
  She has a sense of style
  </h4>
    <p>
    Darcy has clearly refined her meticulous style over her time on Earth. Some shining pieces in her wardrobe include a Pokemon bucket hat, a sketchy $3 cross earring she bought from an old man, and a champion sweatshirt that her mom bought her that for some reason everybody likes.

  <h4>
  She Cares
  </h4>
    <p>
    Darcy is a loyal friend that tries to make sure the people in her life are their best selves they can be. If you date her she’ll give you a truckload of love and affection so be prepared.
    </p>
  <h4>
  She knows how to code
  </h4>
  <p>
  This is the whole reason Darcy is writing this site, it's a coding assignment. Also because she’s lonely.
  </p>
  <h4>
  She’s Funny
  </h4>
  <p>
    I find this site and myself funny, but its all opinion. REMINDER: THIS SITE IS A JOKE (I’m not trying to get bullied).
